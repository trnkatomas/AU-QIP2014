Course of Quantum Infromation Processing

#Quick describtion and disclaimer

All the exercises are my own work (sometimes with inspiration of related scientific papers) and therefore are not perfect

## Exercises
### 1.
Basic product and entagled states.
### 2.
Show that C-NOT gate behavior depends on the basis in we are computing, i.e. the roles for the control and target with respect to some other than classical basis can be swapped.
### 3.
Describtion of the deffered measurement principle.
### 4.
The task was to show that making one step of Grover operator increase the probability of measuring "good" state is three times bigger than in the begginig.
### 5.
My attempt how to describe pretty standard qunatum algorithm for finding collisions
### 6.
Prove of the fact that measurement after applying two different Quantum Fourier transformation yields in ideal case the same probabilistic distribution, or at least something very close to the ideal case. The prove is rather messy and from the second bullet uncorrect - it somehow follow the idea of the prove but the math around is bad.
